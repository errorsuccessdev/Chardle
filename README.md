## How to play
**The game is currently under development. An executable will be made available when it is released.**

Download `chardle.exe` and run in your Windows console environment of choice.

It has been tested with `cmd.exe` and `pwsh`, ymmv in other environments.

## Building

âš  **The answer bank is visible, unobfuscated, in the source code. I don't care if you cheat, but wanted to make you aware.**

You will need a development environment set up for building Win32 applications (I use Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition).
