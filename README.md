# Chardle ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¨â¬› 
Get 6 chances to guess a char[5].

## How to play

Download `chardle.exe` and run it directly, or within your Windows console environment of choice.

You have 6 guesses to guess a randomly-selected 5-letter word. Type your guess (lower case letters only, please) and press enter. You can press escape to quit at any time.

It has been tested with `cmd.exe`, Windows PowerShell, and `pwsh`, ymmv in other environments.

## Building

âš  **The answer bank is visible, unobfuscated, in the source code. I don't care if you cheat, but wanted to make you aware.**

You will need a development environment set up for building Win32 applications (I use Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition).
