This was an explanation of why I couldn't modify Answer

C supports two types of declaring "string literals".
 
One looks like this: 

READONLY
const char *answer = "something";
 
Another like this:
Not readonly!
char answer[] = "something";
 
The first syntax means "write the bytes of the 
string to a readonly part of the executable, and save the 
pointer to those bytes into this variable".
 
The second syntax means "write the bytes of the 
string *to the stack*, and save the pointer into this variable".
 
Guess which one you need :)
 
Your solution worked, because you first copied 
bytes from readonly memory to a regular array.
